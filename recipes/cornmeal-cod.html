        <h2>Crispy cornmeal-crusted cod takes a quick dip in lime juice for extra flavor before pan frying. Is there really anything better than fried fish?</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 cod filets</li>
            <li>1/4 cup lime juice</li>
            <li>2/3 cup cornmeal</li>
            <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive olive</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse cod filets with water. Pat fish dry</li>
            <li>Place lime juice in a shallow bowl. Whisk cornmeal, flour, salt, and pepper together in a separate shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat oil and butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Using tongs, dip cod into lime juice; allow excess to drip off. Press fish into cornmeal mixture to coat on all sides; set aside on a plate.</li>
            <li>Fry cod in the hot skillet until crispy golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and fry until fish flakes easily with a fork and is golden brown on the other side; about 1 minute more. Cooking time will depend on thickness of filets. You may have to fry in batches.</li>
            <li>Remove fish to a wire rack set over a drip tray to catch any excess oil. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
